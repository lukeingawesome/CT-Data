## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Features

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline includes **7 main jobs**:

1. **Code Quality (`lint`)**
   - Black code formatting
   - isort import sorting
   - flake8 linting
   - mypy type checking

2. **Security (`security`)**
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning (safety)
   - Security linting (bandit)

3. **Unit Tests (`test`)**
   - Matrix testing across Python 3.8-3.11
   - Ubuntu and macOS testing
   - CPU-only for CI efficiency
   - Dependency caching

4. **Integration Tests (`integration-test`)**
   - End-to-end workflow testing
   - Coverage report generation
   - Codecov integration

5. **Performance Tests (`performance`)**
   - Benchmark testing (on releases)
   - Performance regression detection

6. **Docker Tests (`docker`)**
   - Container build verification
   - Smoke testing

7. **Deployment (`deploy`)**
   - Release artifact creation
   - Production deployment hooks

### Workflow Triggers

- ✅ **Push** to `main`/`develop` branches
- ✅ **Pull requests** to `main`
- ✅ **GitHub releases**
- ✅ **Scheduled** weekly runs
- ✅ **Manual** trigger support
